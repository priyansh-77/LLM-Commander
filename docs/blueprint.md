# **App Name**: LLM Commander

## Core Features:

- Raw Prompt Input: Text area for users to enter their initial natural language prompt.
- Parameter Configuration: Adjustable temperature setting (slider or input field) to control the randomness of the LLM responses.
- Prompt Refinement Tool: AI-powered tool that applies prompt engineering best practices to optimize the raw prompt for better results across multiple LLMs.
- LLM Selection: Checkboxes or toggles to enable/disable specific LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini).
- API Key Management: Secure input fields to manage API keys for each LLM provider. Keys are stored locally/session-only.
- Side-by-Side Comparison: Display the optimized prompt and the results from each selected LLM in a clean, responsive, side-by-side UI (cards or columns).
- Light/Dark Mode Toggle: Toggle to switch between light and dark UI modes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#667EEA) to represent intelligence and command.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F7FAFC), near-white, for a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#4FD1C5) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, suitable for headlines and short amounts of body text; Body font: 'Inter' for body text.
- Use a set of simple, consistent icons (e.g., Feather icons or Font Awesome) to represent LLMs, settings, and other actions.
- A clear, responsive layout with sections for input, settings, and output. Use cards or columns to display LLM responses.
- Subtle transitions and animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) when loading LLM responses to provide visual feedback.
